This Python script utilizes machine learning techniques, such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost, to predict water potability based on various water quality features, while employing data visualization tools like Plotly and Seaborn for exploratory data analysis.

The code includes preprocessing steps like data scaling and handling missing values, builds and tunes classification models using GridSearchCV, and evaluates their performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1-score on a water potability dataset.

Leveraging popular libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, keras, and xgboost, this project showcases a comprehensive pipeline for water potability prediction, offering insights into feature correlations, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
